# Fixing "Expected token to be set for this request" Error

If you're encountering the error message:

```
Error: Expected token to be set for this request, but none was present
```

This error occurs when the Discord.js REST API is trying to use a token that is not properly set. Here's how to fix it:

## Solution

1. Make sure you have a valid Discord bot token and client ID.

2. You can set these values in one of two ways:

   ### Option 1: Using the `.env` file (Recommended)
   
   Create or edit the `.env` file in the root directory of your project and add:
   
   ```
   TOKEN=your_actual_discord_bot_token
   CLIENT_ID=your_actual_discord_client_id
   ```
   
   Replace `your_actual_discord_bot_token` with your actual Discord bot token and `your_actual_discord_client_id` with your actual Discord application client ID.

   ### Option 2: Using the `config.json` file
   
   Create or edit the `config.json` file in the root directory of your project and add:
   
   ```json
   {
     "token": "your_actual_discord_bot_token",
     "clientId": "your_actual_discord_client_id",
     "guildId": "your_guild_id_here",
     "prefix": "!",
     "embedColor": "#7289DA"
   }
   ```
   
   Replace `your_actual_discord_bot_token` with your actual Discord bot token, `your_actual_discord_client_id` with your actual Discord application client ID, and `your_guild_id_here` with your Discord server ID.

## Where to Find Your Bot Token and Client ID

1. Go to the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
2. Select your application
3. For the Client ID: It's displayed on the "General Information" tab
4. For the Token: Go to the "Bot" tab and click "Reset Token" to get a new token (or "Copy" if you already have one)

## Important Security Notes

- Never share your bot token with anyone
- Do not commit your `.env` or `config.json` file with real tokens to public repositories
- If you accidentally expose your token, reset it immediately in the Discord Developer Portal
